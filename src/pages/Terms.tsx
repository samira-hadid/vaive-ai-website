You acknowledge that access to the Services is on a per-user basis. Each Account holder is entitled to use the Services for their own personal or business use only.

            <p>Require you to purchase an additional subscription to accommodate the additional user.</p>
            <p>Restrict access to certain features or functionalities until additional fees are paid.</p>
            <p>1.5 Security & Monitoring</p>
            <p>You are responsible for the security of your Account and all activities that occur under your Account. You are also responsible for the security and proper handling of all client credentials you provide for the Litigation tool. You agree to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or any suspected security breach related to the Services or the credentials you have provided.

            <p>2.1 Subscription Plans</p>
            <p>We may offer various subscription plans for the Services ("Plans"). Each Plan provides a set of features, functionalities, and access to certain resources. The specific details of each Plan are outlined on our website or within the Service interface.</p>
            <p>2.2 Payment and Billing</p>
            <p>Payment Options: You may be able to use a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and online payment services, to make payments for your subscription.</p>

Vaive.ai will provide advance notice of the then-current Subscription Fee as required by applicable law. By accepting these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you agree to these recurring payment features and accept responsibility for all charges until the Subscription is cancelled by you or Vaive.ai.

            <p>User Input & Data</p>
            <p>5.1 User Input</p>
            <p>The Services allow you to provide data, queries, commands, and credentials ("User Input") for the purpose of utilizing the tools (e.g., questions for the AI basedchatbots, client credentials and litigation details for the Client Litigation tool). You are solely responsible for all User Input you provide to the Services.</p>
            <p>5.2 User Input Rights and Responsibilities</p>
            <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
            <p>You own all rights in and to your User Input (excluding third-party credentials you provide with authorization) or have obtained all necessary consents and permissions to provide the User Input to Vaive.ai for processing via the Services.</p>
            <p>Your User Input, and our processing of it as directed by you, does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other rights of any third party.</p>

            <p>Refund Policy</p>
            <p>6.1 General Policy</p>
            <p>Vaive.ai generally does not offer refunds for subscription fees or payments made for the Services. This is due to the nature of our Services as an online platform providing access to digital tools and resources that incur operational costs regardless of individual user activity.</p>
            <p>6.2 Exceptions to Refund Policy</p>
            <p>Refunds may be considered in the following exceptional circumstances, at our sole discretion:</p>
            <p>Major Service Downtime: If the core Vaive.ai platform and servers are unavailable (excluding scheduled maintenance or issues with specific third-party systems accessed by the Litigation Tool) for an extended period of time due to a fault on our part, we may grant a pro-rata refund for the unused portion of your subscription period impacted by such downtime.</p>
            <p>Fundamental Service Malfunction: If a core functionality of a specific tool (e.g., the GST chatbot is entirely non-responsive, or the Litigation Tool's basic access mechanism fails consistently across multiple attempts due to our fault, not issues with the third-party system or invalid credentials) fails to operate as intended due to a fault on our part, and we cannot provide a reasonable solution within a reasonable timeframe, we may consider a pro-rata refund for the affected portion of the subscription related to that specific tool's failure.</p>
            <p>Technical Issues Beyond Our Control (Rare Cases): In certain rare cases where unforeseen technical issues entirely outside of our direct control prevent you from utilizing the core paid Services as intended, a refund may be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p>6.3 Refund Procedure</p>
            <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund under the exceptional circumstances listed above, you must submit a written refund request to our support team at info@vaive.ai within 30 days of the issue occurring.</p>
            <p>Your request must provide specific details about the issue, including dates, times, the specific tool affected, and the nature of the malfunction or downtime.</p>
            <p>You may be asked to provide supporting documentation, such as screenshots or error logs.</p>
            <p>We will investigate your request and notify you of our decision within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
            <p>6.4 Refund Processing</p>
            <p>If your refund request is approved, the refund will be processed using the same payment method used for the original purchase, where technically possible. The processing time may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.</p>
            <p>6.5 No Refunds for Non-Exceptional Issues</p>
            <p>Please note that we do not provide refunds for issues that do not fall under the exceptional circumstances above, including, but not limited to:</p>
            <p>Changes in your needs or decision to stop using the Services.</p>
            <p>Incorrect Subscription Plan selection.</p>
            <p>User error, misuse of the platform, or violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p>Issues arising from your internet connection, device, or software.</p>
            <p>Issues with third-party systems accessed by the Client Litigation Tool (e.g., changes in third-party system interface, downtime of the third-party system, or rejection of provided credentials by the third-party system).</p>
            <p>Lack of desired outcome or results from using the tools.</p>
            <p>7.1 AI-Powered Assistance and Limitations</p>
            <p>Our AI based chatbots and GST Litigation tool employs artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to assist you in navigating GST laws, case precedents, and related documentation. The AI processes extensive legal data to provide search results, summaries, and potential insights. Our AI models are trained on comprehensive public legal information and publicly available datasets; we do not use your users' data for training these models. While we diligently work to mitigate biases, AI-generated content may not always be exhaustive, current, or perfectly accurate. This tool is designed to supplement, not replace, your professional judgment and independent legal research. Users are solely responsible for verifying all information and its applicability before making any decisions or taking action.</p>
